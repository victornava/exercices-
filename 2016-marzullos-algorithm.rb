# Marzulloâ€™s Algorithm
#
# This one is tricky:
#
#   Given a list of events with arrival and departure times, write a program that
#   determines the time at which the greatest number events occurred.
#
# For instance, you may have ten employees who arrived at work and departed at
# the times shown below (for instance, employee 9 arrived at 12:00noon and
# departed at 5:00pm):
#
# employee   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
#           -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# arrival   10 12 11 13 14 12  9 14 12 10
# departure 15 14 17 15 15 16 13 15 17 18
#
# Then the maximum employee count was at 2:00pm:
#
#  9 |                    7          | 1
# 10 |  1                 7       10 | 3
# 11 |  1     3           7       10 | 4
# 12 |  1  2  3        6  7     9 10 | 7
# 13 |  1  2  3  4     6  7     9 10 | 8
# 14 |  1  2  3  4  5  6     8  9 10 | 9
# 15 |  1     3  4  5  6     8  9 10 | 8
# 16 |        3        6        9 10 | 4
# 17 |        3                 9 10 | 3
# 18 |                            10 | 1
#
# There were 9 employees at work at time 14.
#
# Your task is to write a program that determines the start and end times of the
# time block where the greatest number of events occurred.
